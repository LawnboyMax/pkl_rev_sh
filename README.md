# Pickled Reverse Shell

This repo contains examples of Python objects that start a reverse shell when unpickled. The primary purpose of these files is to accompany [Don't Trust a Pickle](https://hackernoon.com/dont-trust-a-pickle-a77cb4c9e0e) article that I wrote that was published on Medium together with HackerNoon.
